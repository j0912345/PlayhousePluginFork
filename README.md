The entire monolith of Playhouse Plugin.

Feel free to pick and prod as you like. All the code is here as is, half of it is absolute garbage code the other half I'd like to think it's at least half decent. Schematics are also open source on MER (https://github.com/Michal78900/MapEditorReborn/) discord https://discord.com/channels/947849283514814486/952573231204798536/997925149972107366. All schematics were designed and modelled by Moklman, all credit to that goes to him.

I'd like to thank everyone who made the Playhouse what it was, I hope someone can take its place and make more memories for everyone.

Cya.
